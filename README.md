# work-day-scheduler

## This work day scheduler is an application that can be used to help keep track and store tasks that the user inputs for their work day. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I have learned throughout the bootcamp to make this application.

## Installation 
none

## Usage 
The user can select the text box inside of each time block to input a task that they want the work day scheduler to save and keep track of. The user must then push the save button that is on the right side of each of the time blocks. The time boxes will change colors to help represent each task that is in the past, present or future.
